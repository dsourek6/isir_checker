services:
  - type: web
    name: isir-monitor
    env: python
    buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
    startCommand: gunicorn app:app
```

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub (or use Render's direct upload)

**Option A - GitHub (recommended):**
1. Go to github.com and create a new repository
2. Upload your 3 files
3. Keep the repo public (or private if you have a paid plan)

**Option B - Direct upload:**
- Render also lets you upload files directly (but GitHub is better for updates)

### Step 3: Deploy on Render

1. Go to **render.com** and sign up/login
2. Click **"New +"** → **"Web Service"**
3. Connect your GitHub repo (or upload files)
4. Configure:
   - **Name:** `isir-monitor` (or whatever you want)
   - **Environment:** `Python 3`
   - **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command:** `gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`
   - **Instance Type:** `Free`
5. Click **"Create Web Service"**

### Step 4: Wait for deployment (2-3 minutes)

You'll see logs showing the build process. When it says "Deploy live", you're done!

### Step 5: Access Your App

Render will give you a URL like:
```
